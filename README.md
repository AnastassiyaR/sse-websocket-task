# SSE & WebSocket Chat Application 🌐

First experience deploying a full-stack application using Render cloud platform

## Live Demo  

https://sse-websocket-task.onrender.com/

## Project Architecture

This project uses Render to host a full-stack application with:
- **Frontend**: Vue.js (served by Nginx)
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java 21)
- **Deployment**: Docker container with Nginx + Java

**Note**: Free tier on Render spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. First request may take some time to wake up the service. Also I am not sure if it is a correct way to host application but I did my best :)
